#Hunger Not Impossible - README

This project utilizes Angular, SASS (SCSS) for styles, babel for es6 syntax, and Webpack as a module loader.

###Initial Setup:
    Navigate to the project directory where the package.json file is and run `npm install`.

This should install all of the dependencies automatically.

###Daily Use:
    `npm run dev` - Will run the code on the dev server. Access it through http://localhost:4000/index.html#/home.

###Build Process:
    `npm run build` - Will run the webpack build to bundle the code into the dist directory

###Notes:
    Do not add includes to the index.html file. This is handled through webpack automatically.
